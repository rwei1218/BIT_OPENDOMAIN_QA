## Introduction
* Here is our group's project for CCF & Baidu 2019 Reading Comprehension Competition. We apply the competition models to build a open domain QA system, which can process the query-related docs from search engine and outpit short and informative answers. You can ask any questions you want here. 
* This project provide you the training scripts for LIC 2019, a demo server and the pretrained models. Weather you want to study the reading comprehension problem in DuReader dataset or build a open domain QA engine, you can find what you want here.
